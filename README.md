# Electric Vehicle Population Data Analysis

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project involves **exploring and analyzing electric vehicle population data** in the USA.  
The main objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to electric vehicle registration across states, vehicle models, and vehicle makers.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Data Source

The dataset includes information about:
- **Vehicle Type** (Battery Electric or Plug-in Hybrid Electric)
- **Vehicle Model and Make**
- **Model Year**
- **Registration Location (State)**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib** (for data visualization)
- **Seaborn** (for enhanced data visualization)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project includes:
- Distribution of electric vehicle population by state
- Market share by vehicle manufacturer
- Distribution by vehicle models
- Trends in vehicle population by year
- Stacked bar charts and pie charts for clear, comparative visualization

---

## ðŸ”¹ Market Share by Manufacturer

We analyze:
- The percentage each manufacturer holds in the total electric vehicle population.
  
**Visualization:**  
âœ… Bar plot of Market Share by Manufacturer.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Year-on-Year Electric Vehicle Growth

We compute:
- The annual growth rate of electric vehicle registrations.

**Visualization:**  
âœ… A line plot depicting the Year-on-Year Electric Vehicle Growth.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Insights

- The state with the highest number of electric vehicles
- The most popular vehicle makes and models
- The growing popularity of electric vehicles over time
- Market share of battery electric vs plug-in hybrid vehicles

---

## ðŸ”¹ Conclusion

This project illustrates:
- The growing significance of electric vehicles in the USA
- The role of state incentives and policy in their popularity
- The popularity of certain models and makers in the market
